# JavaJSON

JavaJSON is a lightweight JSON parser \& printer for Java.

Full documentation to come.

**NOTE:** I understand that this library offers little protections against
undesirable changes to the representation. As of right now, I'm accepting this
because I'm looking to have a working library for personal use but trust myself
to use my library carefully and correctly. In the future, I will update this
(or you can help me out!) :)

I also know there are libraries that do this already; let a man have fun with
parsing!
